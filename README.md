 This is a Weather web application developed via Node.js, Express, and a few third-party APIs.

 It includes only a single page where a user can observe the weather details of any city around the world.Additionally, it is possible 
 to view the city through a map and also how it looks in the real world.

 All of these features are enabled with the help of APIs.However, anyone using this project should get their own API keys and specify them in .env file.
